SUMMARY:Spoken High School Day Retreat
DESCRIPTION:We are so excited to be having an all day retreat this summer 
 for any teen in the 9-12th grade. This year\, our retreat is called Spoken
 ! Spoken leads teens through the Scriptures and offers unique encounters w
 ith God through prayer and the sacraments so that they live rooted in His 
 Word. This is a great time for teens to share their faith and have fun! We
  will also be providing lunch and dinner for every retreat attendee. Click
